This is a work in progress notes on Unlearning. 


#10 Proposals for unlearning

The common definition of unlearning is "to put out of one's knowledge or memory, to undo the effect of: discard the habit of" according to Merrian-Webster dictionary. However, I hope to use the word unlearning in a broader sense. It can mean forgetting knowledge or habits that may contain power structures worth challenging. It also implies learning in a critical way, not taking anything for granted. Noting this definition, unlearning can be used interchangeably with critical learning, active learning, learning in and out of institutions, and a way of engaging with knowledge in uncommon situations. 


#1. Discovering the site of conflict

When you try to learn something new, often times some kind of conflict arises. Let’s focus on the conflict at the site of learning. The conflict includes tension between teacher and student, as well as the internal conflict within someone who’s learning and teaching. It’s also in this site of conflict that a great amount of learning occurs, if you can transform the conflict into productive energy. Learning here is not limited to obtaining knowledge or studying and memorizing the information, but understanding the conflict and embodying the knowledge in everyday life.

#2. Transforming the conflict into potential energy 


* Acknowledging the conflict 
* Identifying the conflict
* Mapping the conflict 
* Modeling the conflict
* Rearranging the conflict

Even if the conflict didn’t resolve through this process, you may be able to see your relationship with the conflict has been transformed. This transformation is the beginning to critical engagement with information, knowledge, technology and wisdom.

#3. Understanding the body’s potential

Our body as a machine for living, an apparatus for doing things, a medium to bring us together.  We can use our bodies to learn something new. 

Leo Tolstoy: “Our body is a machine for living. It is geared towards it; it is its nature. Let go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself; it will be more effective than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies.”
4. Making new habit 

Learning is usually made possible through forming new habit. Sometimes habit blocks our ability to learn. It can create the very walls that prevent us from learning. However, making new habit can be a good way of learning new ideas.

#5. Creating a habitat for learning

Habitat is the natural home or environment of an animal, plant, or other organism. The most important activity in our daily life is ensuring that we have a habitat. A good habitat is more than just a shelter with access to food, it’s a resourceful place and generous companions. Being in a nurturing environment inspires us to learn from the world around us and each other. 

Habitual learning is learning by transforming your everyday life and environmental state. Physical transformation of space can affect psychological space, which in turn opens up a gap for new knowledge to take place. Habitual learning can also mean learning from things that are already familiar to you. This definition gives more attention to the environment around you. These two meanings are complementary to each other, one can only change the environment by giving attention to the smallest details.

# 6. Affect and Presence


We spend a lot of time and energy feeling emotions and expressing them in language. How about we take a break from communicating socially defined expressions, and instead, focus on the intense transformation in our body prior to emotion and language? This intensity is the affect that’s ‘always prior to and/or outside of consciousness’ as explored by Brian Massumi. 

When we focus on affects, we learn to become aware of another person's presence. When our body roots into the present moment, we can communicate without language.

# 7. Patience 

When we are learning something new, it’s easy to frustrate ourselves because we are not fast enough, or we disappoint ourselves with poor performance. It’s common to have such situations during collaborations. However, it’s very important to become familiar with waiting, and being patient. The most fundamental step in learning and collaboration is waiting for oneself and another person.  

Try a year long collaboration with someone. 
Begin a 30 years project which you will continue on your own. 

Waiting is an act of slowing things done, opening space for more learning. It’s also looking into the distant future and the past and coming to understand the present in a more wholesome perspective. 


# 8. Embracing the uncertainty 

- Uncertainty is a virtue of acknowledging ‘not knowing’. 
- Uncertainty leads to curiosity. 
- Uncertainty brings openness. 
- Uncertainty invites an alternative to acceleration of culture.  

# 9. Neoliberalism and Post-capitalism 

Education is one of the most attractive products in a Capitalist society. There’s always a demand. It’s an interesting product where the customer pays for an experience of learning, and later becomes the product of their own after completing the program.

Sometimes it feels like we are at the long end of the Capitalism. “Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism”(Jameson). This condition is often understood as Neoliberalism, which is categorized by privatization, deregulation, liberalization of the market.  If it’s difficult to imagine life after capitalism, and if capitalism mutates to new forms at every chance, how to learn about the world outside of capitalism?  It’s worth a shot to look at Post-Capitalism, which finds alternatives in the community economy. Perhaps it’s there where we can imagine a community of learning that’s not dependent on monetary exchange.

# 10. Sharing the process of unlearning with others

The act of teaching is one of the best ways to learn. It starts by sharing the process that you learn by trial, error and repetition. Being both the teacher and student of yourself gives a chance to have a dynamic perspective about the knowledge. Most importantly, teaching and learning are a chance to learn to become a mensch, a good person with integrity and honor, someone who supports other people to learn and achieve their dreams.
